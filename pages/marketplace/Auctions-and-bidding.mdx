# Auctions and bidding

- Bidding: Potential buyers can browse through the available listings and place bids on the NFTs they are interested in. Bids must meet or exceed the minimum bid increment set by the seller.
- Automatically handle the auction process, including bid validation, bid increments, and determining the winning bidder.
- Auction End: Once the auction duration has expired, the highest bidder wins the NFT. If the reserve price was set and not met, the seller can choose whether to sell it or not.
