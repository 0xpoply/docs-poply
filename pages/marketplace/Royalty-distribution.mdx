# Royalty distribution

The Royalty Distribution feature in Poply ensures that creators receive a percentage of the sales proceeds whenever their NFTs are resold on the marketplace.<br />

When a user purchases an NFT, the smart contract automatically calculates and sets the royalty percentage for future resales. This percentage is stored within the smart contract of the marketplace and is used to distribute royalties to the creator whenever the NFT is resold.

## Royalty Distribution Algorithm

The royalty distribution algorithm ensures accurate and transparent royalty calculations. It takes into account the resale price, the royalty percentage. The algorithm ensures that the creator receives their entitled royalty amount while maintaining the integrity of the marketplace.

## Error Handling

Poply's smart contract implementation includes robust error handling mechanisms for royalty distribution. In case of any errors or exceptions during the royalty calculation or distribution process, appropriate error codes and messages are returned, providing clear feedback on the encountered issue.
