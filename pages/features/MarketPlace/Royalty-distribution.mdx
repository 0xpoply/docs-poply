# Royalty distribution

contract exposes `getRoyalties` method, which expects an ID as input (usually tokenId) and returns an array of accounts & basis points.

Royalties allows for Poply to support different royalty standards for different collections.

Support on-chain royalties. These are handled in the Exchange contract by the royalties array,
which is needed to execute the mint function.

**This tuple is made up of two variables, `fees.recipient` and `fees.value`:**

`fees.recipient` — refers to either the item owner (by default) or an address where the royalties will be received.

`fees.value` — the royalties percentage. By default, this value is 1000 on Poply , which is a 10% royalties fee. This is done using basis points. More information regarding basis point can be found here.
