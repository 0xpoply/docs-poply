# Revenue Model

Our revenue model is based on a two-tiered approach. Firstly, for each buy and sell transaction on the platform, we will charge a nominal transaction fee of 2% of the total transaction value. This stable percentage ensures that we benefit from the growing NFT market while maintaining affordability for users.

Secondly, for creators utilizing our launchpad to list their NFT projects, we will implement a project listing fee. This fee contributes to the platform's ongoing development and support, enabling creators to access a robust launchpad that drives exposure, funding, and engagement.

By combining these revenue streams, we strike a balance between generating consistent income and fostering an ecosystem that supports both NFT collectors and creators. This model sustains our platform's growth and innovation, ensuring a win-win scenario for all participants.
